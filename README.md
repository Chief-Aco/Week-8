# Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program

## Project Summary
This project was developed for the Corner Grocer to analyze text records of items purchased throughout the day. The program helps the store rearrange their produce section by providing the frequency of items purchased. It includes functionalities to search for specific items, display the frequency of all items, and generate a histogram of item frequencies.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Search for Item Frequency**: Prompt the user to input an item and return the frequency of that item.
2. **Display All Item Frequencies**: Print a list of all items and their purchase frequencies.
3. **Generate Histogram**: Print a histogram representing the frequency of each item.
4. **Exit Program**: Provide an option to exit the program.

## Data File Creation
- The program creates a `frequency.dat` file to back up the accumulated data, listing each item and its frequency.

## Implementation Details
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Development Environment**: Microsoft Visual Studio
- **Key Concepts Used**: Classes, Maps, File Input/Output, User Input Validation

## Reflection
### Project Summary
The Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program was designed to help the store analyze purchase data and optimize their produce layout. The program reads a text file of purchased items and provides various functionalities to display and analyze this data.

### What Did You Do Particularly Well?
I excelled at implementing the histogram feature, which visually represents item frequencies. This feature enhances the program's usability by providing a clear and intuitive way to understand the data.

### Where Could You Enhance Your Code?
I could improve the efficiency of the file reading process by optimizing the way data is parsed and stored. Implementing more robust error handling would also make the program more secure and user-friendly.

### Challenges and Overcoming Them
The most challenging part was managing the file input/output operations and ensuring data integrity. I overcame this by thoroughly testing the file handling functions and using maps to efficiently store and retrieve item frequencies.

### Transferable Skills
Skills such as file handling, data structures (maps), and user input validation are highly transferable to other projects. These skills are fundamental in many programming tasks and will be useful in future coursework and professional projects.

### Maintainability and Readability
I ensured the program is maintainable and readable by using clear variable names, adding in-line comments, and following consistent coding conventions. This makes the code easier to understand and modify.

## How to Run the Program
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. **Open in Visual Studio**: Open the solution file in Microsoft Visual Studio.
3. **Build and Run**: Build the solution and run the program.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to develop a functional and user-friendly program using C++. It showcases my skills in file handling, data analysis, and user interface design.
